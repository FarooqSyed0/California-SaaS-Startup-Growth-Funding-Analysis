# California SaaS Startup Growth & Funding Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the growth and funding landscape of SaaS startups in California. Using real-world data, the goal is to identify high-growth companies, understand geographic trends, and uncover how funding correlates with employee expansion. The results are visualized in an interactive Tableau dashboard.

## Data
- **Source:** Growjo, filtered for California SaaS startups with 1â€“500 employees.
- **Key Variables:** Company name, location, current employees, employee growth rate, year founded, total funding, company URL.
- **Preparation:** Data was cleaned in Excel and Python, loaded into PostgreSQL, and exported as CSV for Tableau visualization.

## Business Impact Questions
- What is the typical employee growth rate for SaaS startups in California?
- How many companies are experiencing high growth, and where are they located?
- What is the relationship between funding and employee growth?
- Which companies are leading in employee growth?

## Technical Approach
- **Data Engineering:** Cleaned and transformed data using Excel and Python (Pandas).
- **Database:** Structured and queried data in PostgreSQL.
- **Analysis:** Explored and validated data with SQL and Python.
- **Visualization:** Built interactive dashboards and charts in Tableau Public (using CSV export).
- **Documentation:** Key metrics and methodology are detailed in [KPIselection.md](src/KPIselection.md)[1].

## Results & Visualizations
- **Median Employee Growth Rate:** 21.88%
- **Number of High-Growth Companies (above 75th percentile):** 211
- **Total Funding (Sum):** $13.16B
- **Top 10 Companies by Employee Growth:** Outlier, Rivian and Volkswagen Group Technologies, Pipeful, PassRight - U.S. Visa, Deccan AI, Agency, GoodOnes, Palona AI, LawPro.ai, Rooster Scheduling
- **Geographic Trends:** San Francisco leads in high-growth companies, followed by Los Angeles, Palo Alto, and San Diego.

## Key Insights & Recommendations
- The majority of high-growth SaaS startups are clustered in the Bay Area, with San Francisco as the clear leader.
- Employee growth is not always directly correlated with funding; several top performers have achieved high growth with moderate funding.
- Stakeholders can use these insights to identify investment opportunities and benchmark startup performance.
