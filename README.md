## Week 1: Data Acquisition & Exploration

### 1.1 Install and configure PostgreSQL on your Mac  
**A:** Successfully installed PostgreSQL using official installer. Configured default port 5432, set up authentication. Tuned shared buffers and workmem.  
*Screenshot uploaded: /screenshots/postgresqlinstallation.png*

### 1.2 Design table structure for funding data  
**A:** Used VARCHAR for names, TEXT for URLs, INTEGER for counts, DECIMAL for growth. Minimal normalization for simplicity, enforced NOT NULL on key fields.  
*Screenshot uploaded: /screenshots/tableschemadesign.png*

### 1.3 Research and download a free startup funding dataset  
**A:** Chose Growjo for SaaS focus and growth metrics. Filtered for CA companies and 1-500 employees. Checked completeness of key variables.  
*Screenshot uploaded: /screenshots/datasetsourceselection.png*

### 1.4 Load data into Excel for initial exploration  
**A:** Found inconsistencies in names and locations. 67 missing funding, 20 missing founded dates. Used Excel validation and conditional formatting.  
*Screenshot uploaded: /screenshots/exceldataexploration.png*

### 1.5 Identify key variables and check data quality  
**A:** Company names 100%, employees 99.5%, growth 98.8%, funding 32.9%. Pivoted to employee growth analysis due to missing funding data.  
*Screenshot uploaded: /screenshots/dataqualityassessment.png*

### 1.6 Define 3-4 core business impact questions  
**A:** Focused on employee growth questions supported by high-quality data. Questions address SaaS scaling, company age, geography, and growth stages.

## Week 2: Data Cleaning & SQL Analysis

### 2.7 Import cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL  
**A:** Fixed VARCHAR length errors in DBeaver by switching to TEXT for URL columns. Ensured all columns matched the cleaned CSV. Optimized data types. Removed obsolete table newtable after confirming all work references startupfundinganalysis. Ran DROP TABLE IF EXISTS newtable for cleanup.  
*Screenshot uploaded: /screenshots/importsuccess.png*

### 2.8 Test basic SQL queries  
**A:** Ran row count, null checks, min/max, uniqueness, funding statistics, and duplicate checks. Results: Row count matched CSV, minimal nulls in key columns, realistic funding and employee ranges, no problematic duplicates.  
*Screenshot uploaded: /screenshots/sqlvalidation.png*

### 2.9 Write SQL queries to answer business questions  
**A:** Drafted queries for employee growth, funding by location, and company age distribution. Discovered a few high-funding outliers and adjusted analysis to use median and percentiles.  
*Screenshot uploaded: /screenshots/businessqueries.png*

### 2.10 Use Python Pandas for further cleaning  
**A:** Updated all .fillna operations to assign directly to DataFrame columns (e.g., df['employeegrowth'] = df['employeegrowth'].fillna(mediangrowth)) instead of using inplace=True. Completed data cleaning steps: standardized text fields, handled missing values, converted date columns, removed duplicates, and calculated company age.  
*Screenshot uploaded: /screenshots/pythoncleaninganalysis.png*

### 2.11 Create simple visualizations to validate insights  
**A:** Created histogram for employee growth distribution and scatter plot for employee growth vs. total funding. Key findings: histogram revealed most companies have moderate employee growth, a few extreme outliers; scatter plot showed most companies cluster at lower funding/growth, with outliers. Visuals validated main patterns.  
*Screenshots uploaded: /screenshots/employeegrowthdistribution.png, /screenshots/growthvsfunding.png*

### 2.12 Set up Python Anaconda Jupyter Notebook  
**A:** Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook were already installed and configured prior to this step. Successfully ran Python code for data cleaning and analysis in Jupyter Notebook. No configuration challenges encountered. Common libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn. Environment optimized for data analysis workflows.  
*Screenshot uploaded: /screenshots/jupytersetup.png*

### 2.13 Ensure VS Code with Cursor AI is ready for development  
**A:** VS Code and Cursor AI are fully installed and configured. All core data analysis extensions are installed, including Python, Jupyter, Pylance, GitLens, Data Wrangler, and more, as shown in the attached extension list screenshot. No integration issues encountered; environment is ready for data analysis workflows.  
*Screenshot uploaded: /screenshots/vscode-extensions-list.jpg*

### 2.14 Create a new GitHub repository for your project  
**A:** Repository is organized with folders for source code, notebooks, data, checklists, and screenshots. Naming conventions use clear, lowercase names. Initial commit includes a README, .gitignore, and .gitattributes. Additional folders and files for data, notebooks, and source code will be added as the project progresses.

## Week 3: Visualization & Dashboard Design

### 3.15 Sketch dashboard wireframe for Tableau Public  
**A:** The dashboard wireframe prioritizes KPIs at the top (Median Employee Growth, High-Growth Companies, Funding), filters on the left, and main charts (Top 10 by Employee Growth, Growth Distribution, Growth vs. Funding) in the center, with a geographic map at the bottom. Layout is clear, fast to scan, and interactive.  
*Screenshot uploaded: /screenshots/dashboardwireframe.png*

### 3.16 Identify key metrics and KPIs for dashboard  
**A:** See [Key Metrics and KPI Selection](#key-metrics-and-kpi-selection) section below.

### 3.17 Connect Tableau Public to PostgreSQL  
**A:** Tableau Public does not support direct PostgreSQL connections; it only allows connections to local files (CSV, Excel) and Google Sheets. I exported the cleaned data from PostgreSQL to a CSV file and connected Tableau Public to this CSV for all dashboard development. No database authentication was required; the connection was established by selecting the CSV file from my local system.  
*Screenshot uploaded: /screenshots/tableauconnection.png*

### 3.18 Build visualizations (charts, KPIs, filters)  
**A:** Created KPI cards for Median Employee Growth, Number of High-Growth Companies, and Total Funding. Used a bar chart for Top 10 Companies by Employee Growth, a histogram for employee growth distribution, a scatter plot for employee growth vs. total funding, and a map for geographic distribution. Data limitations were addressed by focusing on fields with high completeness and using medians to reduce outlier impact. Interactivity features include filters and tooltips in Tableau.  
*Screenshot uploaded: /screenshots/tableaucharts.png*

### 3.19 Combine visuals into an interactive dashboard  
**A:** The Tableau dashboard combines all key KPIs and visualizations in a single, interactive view. KPIs are placed at the top for quick insights, with supporting charts (bar, histogram, scatter, map) arranged for logical flow and clarity. Filters and tooltips enhance interactivity and user exploration. The layout was refined for readability and business relevance. Performance was optimized by using a CSV extract and limiting visual complexity. The final design was reviewed for clarity and business relevance.

## Week 4: Documentation, Publishing, and Portfolio Prep

### 4.20 Document your process in GitHub README  
**A:** See README.md

### 4.21 Summarize key findings and business impact  
**A:** Key findings and recommendations are summarized in the README and portfolio documentation.

### 4.22 Publish dashboard to Tableau Public  
**A:** The Tableau dashboard was published to Tableau Public using data from Growjo, which is publicly available and contains only company-level, non-personal information. There are no privacy concerns with this dataset. The dashboard is set to public access, includes descriptive titles, tags, and a clear project summary for discoverability. The Tableau Public link is included in the README and project documentation.  
*Screenshot uploaded: /screenshots/tableaupublicpublish.png*

### 4.23 Prepare project for portfolio website/LinkedIn/Notion  
**A:** See portfolioprep.md. Project summary and links added to Notion.  
*Screenshot uploaded: /screenshots/portfolioprep.png*
